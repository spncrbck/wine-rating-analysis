# Wine Rating Analysis

As I am new to data science, I wanted to start with a readily-available dataset which was in the scope of my interests. As a hobby wine connoisseur, I chose [zackthoutt's 'Wine Reviews' data set](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews/kernels?sortBy=voteCount&group=everyone&pageSize=20&datasetId=1442) from Kaggle. This dataset includes around 130,000 wine reviews scraped from [WineMag](https://www.winemag.com/). More information on their data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews/home).

This page will be where I build my report to showcase my skills and do some analysis on the data.
